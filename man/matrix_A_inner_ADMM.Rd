\title{Determine matrix \eqn{A} for inner-ADMM for the \eqn{Z}-update step}
\usage{

\arguments{
\item{m}{Number of graphs}

\item{D}{Matrix D, see \code{\link{create_matrix_D}}}
}

Value of \eqn{a}

\description{
The \eqn{Z}-update step, see \code{\link{updateZ}}, requires 
us to solve a special Generalized LASSO problem of the form 
\deqn{
  \hat{\beta} = \text{argmin } \frac{1}{2} || y - \beta ||_2^2 + ||D\beta||_1 
}
where \eqn{\beta} and \eqn{y} are \eqn{m}-dimensional vectors and 
\eqn{D} is a \eqn{(c \times m)}-matrix where \eqn{c \geq m}. 
We solve this optimization problem using an adaption of the ADMM
algorithm presented in Zhu (2017). 
This algorithm requires the choice of a matrix \eqn{A} such that 
\eqn{A - D'D} is positive semidefinite. In order to optimize the ADMM, 
we choose the matrix \eqn{A} to be diagonal with a fixed value \eqn{a}. 
This function determines the smallest value of \eqn{a} such that 
\eqn{A - D'D} is indeed positive semidefinite. It does so by solving 
a semidefinite program very much related to the student educational problem.
